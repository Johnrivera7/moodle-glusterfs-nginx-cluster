# Moodle GlusterFS Nginx Cluster

Automated script for deploying a Moodle cluster with GlusterFS as the distributed file system and Nginx as the web server.

## Repository Overview

This script automates the deployment of a Moodle cluster with GlusterFS as the distributed file system and Nginx as the web server. The cluster consists of multiple Moodle nodes, and GlusterFS ensures data replication for high availability.

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu servers for each Moodle node.
- Open ports for GlusterFS (24007, 111, 49152-49251, 2049), Nginx (80, 443), and SSH (22).
- Instances should have a valid hostname.

## Usage

1. Run the script on each Moodle node.
2. Configure Nginx, PHP, and Moodle settings interactively.
3. The script sets up GlusterFS for distributed file storage.
4. Follow on-screen instructions for each node.

### Notes

- This script was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 instances.
- Ensure proper firewall or security group configurations.
- The script installs the latest version of Moodle.
- Start the script on slave nodes first, then on the master node.
